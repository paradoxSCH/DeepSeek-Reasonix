<h3 align="center">A DeepSeek-native AI coding agent for your terminal.</h3>
<p align="center">Engineered around prefix-cache stability — so token costs stay low across long sessions, and you can leave it running.</p>

<br/>

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/hero-terminal.svg" alt="Reasonix code mode — assistant proposes a SEARCH/REPLACE edit; nothing on disk until /apply" width="860"/>
</p>

<br/>

> [!TIP]
> **Cache stability isn't a feature you turn on; it's an invariant the loop is designed around.** That's the whole reason Reasonix is DeepSeek-only — every layer is tuned to the byte-stable prefix-cache mechanic.

> [!NOTE]
> **Real user, single day (2026-05-01):** 435M input tokens, **99.82% cache hit**, ~$12 instead of the ~$61 the same workload would cost with no cache on `v4-flash` — see the [case study](./benchmarks/real-world-cache/README.md). DeepSeek provides the cacheable bytes; the four mechanisms in [Pillar 1](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#pillar-1--cache-first-loop) are how Reasonix keeps them cacheable across long sessions.

<br/>

## Web search

Reasonix includes `web_search` and `web_fetch` tools. By default it uses **Mojeek** (no setup required). You can switch to a **self-hosted SearXNG** instance — a metasearch engine that aggregates whatever upstream engines your instance is configured for.

### Switching engines (persists to disk)

The `/search-engine` slash command (alias `/se`) writes your choice to `~/.reasonix/config.json` immediately — it survives restarts:

```
/search-engine mojeek              # default, no external deps
/search-engine searxng             # SearXNG at http://localhost:8080
/search-engine searxng http://192.168.1.100:8888  # custom endpoint
```

Equivalent `~/.reasonix/config.json`:

```json
{
  "webSearchEngine": "searxng",
  "webSearchEndpoint": "http://localhost:8080"
}
```

The tool picks up the change on the next call — no restart needed.

### Starting SearXNG

```sh
podman run -d --replace --name searxng -p 8080:8080 docker.io/searxng/searxng
# or: docker run -d -p 8080:8080 searxng/searxng
```

Verify it's running:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8080/search?q=test
# → HTML search results page
```

> **Note:** The endpoint must include the protocol (`http://`). `localhost:8080` alone will fail — the tool will show a clear error telling you to install SearXNG if the server is unreachable.

<br/>

## Install

```bash
cd my-project
npx reasonix code   # paste a DeepSeek API key on first run; persists after
```

Requires Node ≥ 22. Tested on macOS · Linux · Windows (PowerShell · Git Bash · Windows Terminal). Get a [DeepSeek API key →](https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys) · `reasonix code --help` for flags.

`npx` is the recommended path — no global install, always picks up the latest version. If you'll use Reasonix daily and want `reasonix` on your `PATH`, run `reasonix update` once and it'll do the `npm install -g` for you.

### Subcommand cheatsheet

| Command | When to use |
|---|---|
| `reasonix code [dir]` | Coding agent rooted at a project. **Start here.** |
| `reasonix chat` | Plain chat — no filesystem tools, just a conversation with persisted history. |
| `reasonix run "task"` | One-shot, streams the answer to stdout. Good for shell pipes. |
| `reasonix doctor` | Environment health check (Node version, API key, MCP wiring). |
| `reasonix update` | Upgrade Reasonix itself. |

Other subcommands (`replay` · `diff` · `events` · `stats` · `index` · `mcp` · `prune-sessions`) are listed in `reasonix --help` and on the [CLI reference](https://esengine.github.io/DeepSeek-Reasonix/#cli).

**Working in a different folder:** Reasonix scopes filesystem tools to the launch directory. To work elsewhere, pass `--dir`:

```bash
npx reasonix code --dir /path/to/project   # or use a relative path
```

Mid-session switching isn't supported by design (the message log + memory paths get tangled with stale roots). Quit and relaunch with a new `--dir` to retarget. `/status` always shows the current pinned workspace.

**Author your first skill:** Skills are markdown playbooks the model can invoke (`/skill <name>`). There's no remote registry yet — you author them directly:

```bash
/skill new my-skill          # scaffolds <project>/.reasonix/skills/my-skill.md
/skill new my-skill --global # or under ~/.reasonix/skills for cross-project use
```

Edit the file (`description:` frontmatter + body), then `/skill list` to see it. Add `runAs: subagent` to the frontmatter to spawn an isolated subagent loop instead of inlining the body.

<br/>

## What makes Reasonix different

The loop is organized around three pillars. Each one solves a problem generic agent frameworks don't even see — because they were designed for a different cache mechanic.

For live cache-hit rates, costs, and methodology, see [`benchmarks/`](./benchmarks/) — the numbers move with model pricing, so they live with the harness, not in the README.

## Non-goals

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Reasonix is opinionated. Some things it deliberately *doesn't* do — listed here so you can pick the right tool for your work.

- **Multi-provider flexibility.** DeepSeek-only on purpose. Coupling to one backend is the feature, not a limitation.
- **IDE integration.** Terminal-first. The diff lives in `git diff`, the file tree in `ls`. The dashboard is a companion, not a Cursor replacement.
- **Hardest-leaderboard reasoning.** Claude Opus still wins some benchmarks. DeepSeek is competitive on coding; if your work is "solve this PhD proof" rather than "fix this auth bug," start with Claude.
- **Air-gapped / fully-free.** Reasonix needs a paid DeepSeek API key. For air-gapped or zero-cost runs see Aider + Ollama or [Continue](https://continue.dev).
